# mono-repo-test-deployment

The idea here is to create a POC workflow that's able to detect changes applied to a specific folder and trigger a deployment based on the folder(s) such change(s) was applied to.

for this demo I have an `inventory/` and `sales/` sub folder and would love to appply test worflow behavior when I apply changes to either of these folders
